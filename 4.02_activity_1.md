# 4.02 Activity 1

Keep working with `unit4.csv` you that you already have locally - the same dataset you used in the previous lesson. (_We didn't add the file once again within this activity folder, since it is a large file that would consume unnecessary space on your drive._)

Discuss which option is better to clean the rows where the values are empty for the column `DOMAIN`.

- Option 1: Filtering the rows with the empty values.
- Option 2: Replacing the empty values with some other category, the most frequently represented value in that column.
